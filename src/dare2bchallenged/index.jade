        .column-2
          p Our Transformation Series continued to feature prominent international business practitioners and motivational speakers whose insights and experiences can be translated into practical principles that participants can apply in their career or personal lives.
          p This year, our two Transformation Series events showcased Karina Hollekim, a female skier who took on the sport again after a paralysing parachute incident, and Yossi Ghinsberg, the legendary Amazon jungle survivor. They inspired their audience with personal accounts of how they rose from adversity to become stronger and more adaptable, and how it helped them find a new purpose in life and empowered them to continue pushing boundaries to excel.

            p As part of our social mission, SIM continued to partner the Social Service Institute (SSI), the training arm of the National Council of Social Service, to organise the Tote Board-SSI Global Leader Series for Non-Profits.

        .column-2
          p The right competencies can help one stay relevant and future ready. This was the key message of the 2019 CEO Dialogue, themed ‘New Digital Economy, New Global Competencies. Are You Ready?’. The dialogue was helmed by SIM Holdings Chief Executive Officer Dr Lee Kwok Cheong, alongside two C-suite SIM GE alumni (Azmoon Ahmad, former Nominated Member of Parliament, and Oliver Tan, Singapore Computer Society Entrepreneur of the Year) to share leadership and industry insights with alumni, students as well as industry partners.
          p The event was webcast live for the first time for the benefit of our overseas alumni.

            h2.title.t--green.mt-0 REWRITING THE RULES
            p In a world disrupted by technological advancements, education must continue to adapt and evolve to equipped learners to take on challenges in an ever-changing world. This was the focus of the inaugural ‘DisruptED’, the Straits Times-SIM Forum on Disruptions in Education. Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Education, and Communications and Information, gave the introduction at the forum which was attended by over 350 guests comprising educators, students and parents. This was followed by panel discussions with the audience led by local and international education experts, including Ben Nelson from the famed Minerva college.
            p Likewise, the future of education was in the spotlight when SIM GE partnered Channel NewsAsia on the ‘Foresight’ series for the second year running. With Singapore chairing the ASEAN in 2018, the six-part series focused on ‘ASEAN Foresight’. A vibrant panel discussion by senior industry executives and SIM leaders on emerging trends and challenges of education in the ASEAN context attracted more than 1.5 million viewers.

          p According to a report by the United Nations, the world population is expected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050, putting tremendous pressure for more sustainable food production as well as more effective food distribution and waste management.  At the same time, growing prevalence of health issues such as diabetes and obesity across the world pose a challenge for healthier food options.
          p To address this global issue, Platform E (PE) founded and is the inaugural Chairman of FEED 9 Billion (F9B), a coalition formed to cultivate and facilitate innovations in food science and technology, and to address disruption in the food industry for start-ups and enterprises. F9B is a quadripartite partnership with Temasek Polytechnic, Innovate 360 (Singapore’s first food manufacturing accelerator) and FocusTech Ventures.
          p The partnership took off with an inaugural Food Entrepreneurship, Exploration & Design (FEED) Camp. The camp gathered innovators and researchers from multinational corporations, and entrepreneurs to develop innovative ideas in food technology. Two of the participants from the FEED camp are planning to launch their ventures and food products in 2019. As a follow-through to the FEED Camp, aspiring entrepreneurs can join PE’s Food Innovation Programme in 2019 to gain a deep understanding of the global food ecosystem and receive training and leverage F9B’s ecosystem to get their innovative ideas ready for market.
