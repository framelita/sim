            p As at the end of December, SIM GE offers a suite of over 80 diploma and degree programmes with 12 university partners across arts and social sciences, business, information technology, computer science and other specialty areas like nursing and aviation.
            p As a testament to our quality, our programmes by University of Birmingham, La Trobe University, University of London, RMIT University and University of Wollongong received accreditation from the Chinese Service Centre of Scholarly Exchange, an affiliation to the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China.
            p These accreditations for SIM GE's partner universities in China differentiate our graduates and open doors for them to employment and career advancement opportunities in China.
            p Once again, our students made us very proud with their stellar academic achievements. For example, we had a record-breaking 227 University of London (UOL) graduates who obtained First Class Honours. This made us the teaching centre with the highest number of First Class Honours graduates among all UOL centres worldwide, a record we have been maintaining for over 10 years. In addition, 39 SIM GE students, the highest number to date, received the UOL award for academic achievement, which is given to the best candidates around the world who take the examinations each year. Separately, a commendable 70% of the SIM-University at Buffalo graduates obtained Latin Honours.

            p The academy offers a blend of the Singapore and Cambridge curricula to equip students with knowledge and skills such as in critical thinking and communication, as well as to emphasise the importance of embracing the Cambodian culture through the learning of the Khmer language. To groom the students into well-rounded individuals and self-directed lifelong learners, a holistic education approach is adopted with the offering of both core and non-core subjects such as information and communications technology; entrepreneurship; character, leadership and global education; and physical education.

            p As part of our business consolidation, we will discontinue the offering of the international Cambridge programmes under <strong class="t--orange">SIM International Academy (SIM IA)</strong>. To ensure minimal disruption to our students, the programmes will be phased out gradually.
            p Our students at SIM IA did us proud. Six students participated in the Southeast Asia Mathematics Competition for the first time and emerged as overall runners-up with a total of three gold, four silver and four bronze awards. They then proceeded to the World Mathematics Competition in Melbourne where one student emerged as one of the top eight performers in the Junior category.

          p <strong class="t--blue">SIM Professional Development (SIM PD)</strong> inspires professionals, managers, and executives to embrace, adapt and keep pace with a fast-paced, volatile and ambiguous world driven by advancement in technologies and shifting socio-political dynamics. We continually review our programmes and initiatives to ensure they are relevant to working professionals and the companies they work in. A new range of programmes focusing on data science and analytics, cognitive flexibility, industrial Internet of Things, cyber security, artificial intelligence, and system and human design thinking were introduced.
          p To provide our professionals with global business perspectives, we arranged overseas learning immersion programmes to countries such as Kenya. The professionals from these countries also benefitted from the exchange as they learned best practices of companies in Singapore.
          p Besides training individuals, SIM PD works with companies to customise training solutions that help achieve business objectives, such as in leadership effectiveness and innovation. As part of the training, we facilitated learning from industriesâ€™ best practices through visits to organisations like the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, PUB and Supreme Court.
          p Another aspect of our work with companies was developing management and talent development programmes to help them attract and retain high potential employees. Leveraging technology, we developed a microsite to help companies identify business challenges and the type of learning interventions required to help them surmount these challenges.
          p SIM PD collaborated with Pure and Good Management, a leading integrated trade service provider for halal products, to develop a professional training roadmap to help businesses tap on the fast-growing halal industry. Companies will benefit from being equipped with the right skills in the areas of Islamic financing and leveraging existing trade arrangements within the halal market in ASEAN countries. This will allow them to expand their business offerings to meet the increasing demands for halal products and services from around the world, with Singapore as the hub.

          p <strong class="t--purple">Platform Eâ€™s (PE)</strong> graduated its first cohort of 21 participants in April and had 16 budding entrepreneurs enrolled in its entrepreneurship programme as at December 2018. Of these 37 entrepreneurs, 14 startups have been established, more than $2m have been successfully raised from investors, and eight have also started earning revenue.
          p An open demo day was organised and PE's participants competed with other start-ups to pitch their business ideas to a panel of angel investors and venture capitalist companies. Two of PE's participants won the first and second runner-up prizes, and the first runner-up subsequently won a pitch contest in South Korea.
          p PE's ecosystem has grown significantly, with more partners coming on board and contributing to the success of the start-ups. 14 PE participants and alumni utilised the co-working space to network with the community, kick-start and grow their ventures. Examples included taking part in PE partners' incubation programme and podcast platform. Sharing sessions and events on innovation and entrepreneurship were also organised by PE and the companies within its community.
