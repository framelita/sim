            p <strong class="t--green">At SIM Global Education (SIM GE)</strong>, we remain steadfast in helping our students gain a head start in life with programmes that hone their competencies and boost their employability.   While we continue to update our existing programmes to ensure they remain relevant, we also introduced new programmes that develop talent to meet new and emerging needs of the economy.

            p As at the end of December, SIM GE offers a suite of over 80 diploma and degree programmes with 12 university partners across arts and social sciences, business, IT, computer science and other specialty areas like nursing and aviation.
            p As a testament to our quality, our programmes by University of Birmingham, University of London, RMIT University and University of Wollongong received accreditation from the Chinese Service Centre of Scholarly Exchange, an affiliation to the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China.
            p These accreditations for SIM GE's partner universities in China differentiate our graduates and open doors for them to employment and career advancement opportunities in China.
            p Once again, our students made us very proud with their stellar academic achievements. For example, we had a record-breaking 227 University of London (UOL) graduates who obtained First Class Honours. This made us the teaching centre with the highest number of First Class Honours graduates among all UOL centres worldwide, a record we have been maintaining for over 10 years. In addition, 39 SIM GE students, the highest number to date, received the UOL award for academic achievement, which is given to the best candidates around the world who take the examinations each year. Separately, a commendable 70% of the SIM â€“ University at Buffalo graduates obtained Latin Honours.
